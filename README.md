# DigitalClock
Mini Project with the use of Javascript.

If you’re on a website or using web applications with a self-updating time feature (you know, a clock), there’s a very good chance it’s powered by JavaScript code. This means JavaScript clocks don’t just make for good JavaScript projects, a JavaScript clock lets you get hands-on with the kind of actual work you’ll be doing as a JavaScript developer.

JavaScript code makes it possible to coordinate the lolcat images with set times picked by the user or by pushing the “Party Time!” button. I can haz time? Yes you can.!
